# ASP.NET Core 5.0 Pure DI Example

A simplistic example of utilizing Pure DI in ASP.NET Core 5.0 Web API
project.

The __Composition Root__ is implemented in a custom
IControllerActivator and IMiddlewareFactory. Main problem solved here
is how to dispose of IDisposable dependencies, including objects with
both _singleton_ and _request-scoped_ lifestyle.

### Usage

Try to build and run the application in console, e.g. on Linux with
`Debug | Any CPU` configuration:

```
$ dotnet build
$ ./AspNetCorePureDiApi/bin/Debug/netcoreapp5.0/AspNetCorePureDiApi
```

Open a web browser, and navigate to
`http://localhost:5000/api/hello`. Refresh the page several times. In
the console, observe how scoped dependencies get disposed after each
request. The controller response includes ids of its dependencies (one
singleton and one scoped). A middleware then adds some extra
information to the response, reporting its own dependencies.

When finished, press `Ctrl+C` in the console to shut down the
application to see that singleton dependencies get disposed as well.


### Implementation

Implementation replaces the default ControllerActivator and
MiddlewareFactory with a custom class which serves as the Composition
Root. The `CompositionRoot` class is registered in default ASP.NET
Core's DI container (`IServicesCollection`) as singleton and gets
disposed when application shuts down. This in turn, disposes all of
the singleton dependencies held by the `CompositionRoot`. Scoped
controller dependencies are registered for disposal in
`ControllerContext.HttpContext.Response` and get automatically
disposed by the framework along with the response. Scoped middleware
dependencies are disposed in a similar manner.

Note that despite the fact that all the DI logic is implemented in the
`CompositionRoot`, I would probably delegate the responsibility of
creating dependency graphs to another class or classes in a real life
project.

See comments in the code for more information.


#### Request-Scoped Dependencies Issue

With the current implementation, when using IMiddlewareFactory to
create request-scoped middleware, there are two scopes created per web
request: one for middleware's dependencies and one for
controller's. I.e. if for example both UserMiddleware and
UserController depend on IUserRepository, and IUserRepository should
have request scoped lifetime, then there will be two separate
instances of IUserRepository created.

It is potentially possible to workaround this issue by using
`AsyncLocal<IDictionary<Type, object>>` field that gets populated with
dependencies in `IMiddlewareFactory.Create` method and consumed by
`IControllerActivator.Create`. However we are loosing compile-time
checking of dependencies in the latter method (when creating a
controller), which is the whole point of Pure DI. Solving this problem
also moves us close to implementing our own DI container - not
something we aim to do here.

A compromise could be to only allow singleton middlewares, as in
classic Microsoft.Owin pipeline but that of course poses other
limitations.


### Discussion

It is entirely possible that there is a better way to do this, or that
such implementation has potential problems which I don't see. Comments
are welcome in the Issues section.
